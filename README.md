# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using the California Housing Prices dataset. The notebook provides a comprehensive workflow, including data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and interpretation. The primary goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately predict house prices based on various features.

## California Housing Prices Dataset

### Brief History

The California Housing Prices dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. Census and includes various features such as the median income, average house occupancy, and geographical location. The dataset is commonly used in machine learning for regression tasks and is available in the Scikit-learn library.

## Scikit-Learn Library

Scikit-learn is a powerful Python library for machine learning, providing simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. The library includes various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. In this project, Scikit-learn is used for data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## Models Used

### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm used for predicting a target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. The model aims to find the best-fitting straight line (regression line) that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.

### Decision Tree

A Decision Tree is a non-linear model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values. Each node in the tree represents a decision based on a feature, and each branch represents the outcome of that decision. The leaves of the tree represent the final predicted values. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can capture non-linear relationships in the data.

### Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the model's accuracy and robustness. Each tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the data, and the final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of all the trees. This method reduces overfitting and improves generalization.

## Use-Cases and Expansion

### Use-Cases

1. **Real Estate Market Analysis:** Predict house prices to help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
2. **Investment Analysis:** Assist investors in identifying profitable properties.
3. **Urban Planning:** Aid in planning and development by analyzing housing trends.

### Expansion to Other Datasets

This code can be adapted to other datasets for various regression tasks by following these steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Load the new dataset.
2. **Data Exploration:** Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and outliers.
